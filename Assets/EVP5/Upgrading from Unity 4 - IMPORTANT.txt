Edy's Vehicle Physics for Unity 5
http://www.edy.es/dev/vehicle-physics
------------------------------------------------

UPGRADING FROM UNITY 4

MOST IMPORTANT:
There is no direct upgrade path for projects using Edy's Vehicle Physics 4.4 or earlier.

Unfortunately, the major changes in the physics in Unity 5 makes impossible to directly upgrade a
project in Unity 4 to work the same in Unity 5.

New projects will be working from the beginning, but projects coming from Unity 4 require an
important upgrade process at both scripts and vehicle configuration. The vehicle behavior and
gameplay require to be configured and fine-tuned again.

However, the new package for Unity 5 has a much better design and vehicles can be composed and
configured much faster. Please take a look a the new documentation for Unity 5:
